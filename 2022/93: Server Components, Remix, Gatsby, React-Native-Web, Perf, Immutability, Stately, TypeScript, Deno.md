[**Shopify: React Server Components best practices**](https://shopify.engineering/react-server-components-best-practices-hydrogen?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Cathryn’s feedback on the usage of Servers Components at Shopify, which she learned to use through their new [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) framework. Without best practices, you might not leverage this new React feature properly and end-up with a bundle larger than it could be.She advises to use Shared Components by default, instead of Client Components (what we use today). For interactivity, extract some Client Components with the finest granularity. Then try to convert the rest to Server Components if it’s possible. The composition patterns (usage of `children`) that [we sometimes use to optimize](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1096115287781400576?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) can also be used to interleave components of different types.She offers a real decision tree, which she illustrates with 2 examples: newsletter signup and product FAQ.A Shopify tutorial using server components has also been published: [Rapid Development with Hydrogen: Building a Product Page](https://shopify.engineering/rapid-development-hydrogen-building-product-page?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

[**How to write performant React apps with Context**](https://www.developerway.com/posts/how-to-write-performant-react-apps-with-context?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Nadia explains how you can optimize rendering on a complex React form using the React context. First, you have to separate into 2 contexts and hooks `useFormData()` and `useFormAPI()`. Do not forget to memorize properly the `api` object. We can eventually split the state into several smaller contexts.These techniques may not scale as well as a real state manager, but are still useful to know in case you can’t use one.

[**The “best” way to manage icons in React.js**](https://benadam.me/thoughts/react-svg-sprites/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

There are many ways to use icons in React, each with different tradeoffs.`.svg` files cannot be styled in CSS. React components that render SVG (also applies to SVGR) are convenient, but they inline the SVG markup in the HTML output and makes the page heavier. In my experience, we see this problem very quickly on a static pages (or SSR) that uses the same icon many times.Ben offers a great, lesser-known alternative: using SVG sprites.

I’m particularly interested in the usage of Server Components in React-Native (or at least some Server-Driven UI) and co-locating data requirements with screens (think Remix/`loader`, Next.js/`getServerProps` but for React-Navigation)

No surprise it’s a good platform to deploy Remix applications.This is probably in response to the [new web APIs announced last week for Node.js 18](https://twitter.com/MylesBorins/status/1489024782205173760?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

[**Immutability isn’t free**](https://swizec.com/blog/immutability-isnt-free/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Funny story, in a backend context but largely applicable to React apps. The usage of FP and immutability led to bad performances related to array copying and an `O(n2)` algorithm. Moving back to mutable code significantly increased the performances.Note: it is also possible to get better performances with immutability by using [vector tries and structural sharing](https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), used internally by libs such as [ImmutableJS](https://immutable-js.com/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

Note that Blitz (Simon is a contributor) [pivots to Blitz Toolkit](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz/discussions/3075?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to provide similar services.
