[**Using global memoization in React**](https://thoughtspile.github.io/2022/02/09/react-global-memo/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Vladimir explains that sometimes `useMemo` is not enough, and we need to share cached data between multiple components. He suggests 5 ways to cache data in a global way outside React components, from a single constant to a LRU cache.My opinion: using [WeakMap](https://javascript.info/weakmap-weakset?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) could also be a nice solution, and why not provide the cache inside a React context.

[**React component as prop: the right way™️**](https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-component-as-prop-the-right-way?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Nadia gives good reasons to use React composition. She uses a button with text + icon as an example, suggest 3 alternatives and compare them under different update scenarios:
-   `icon={<MyIcon/>}`
-   `Icon={MyIcon}`
-   `renderIcon={(...settings) <Icon {...settings}/>}`I don’t like much the 1st one, and try to avoid `cloneElement` whenever I can.

They plan to introduce a global and per-route config to enable the Edge runtime. This is interesting in many ways: enable streaming SSR, lower latency… Note that Remix already has this somehow thanks to its adapter layer.

Alexandre presents his Flipper plugin to measure React-Native performances (UI & JS thread FPS) continuously and compute a score like Lighthouse.He also shares 4 tips to help you measure performances on your apps. TIL about automating scroll with `adb`. All this is then applied in practice to a concrete use-case: his team improved the score of the TF1 app from 40 to 90.

Note that a similar initiative exists for iOS ([react-native-native-runtime](https://github.com/shirakaba/react-native-native-runtime?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)) but not sure Apple would approve 😝

[**Hello, CSS Cascade Layers**](https://ishadeed.com/article/cascade-layers/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

A nice intro to CSS Cascade layers, a new CSS feature to look forward! It looks like it [is coming fast](https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1492655597459808258?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) in our browsers, and even if you can’t use it today (no polyfill), that’s worth taking a look at it today.CSS Cascade Laters give additional control on the CSS cascade, and the order in which CSS rules are applied. This can help fixing problems related to specificity, insertion order or reduce the need to use `!important`.If you only have 1 minute, [take a look at this animation](https://twitter.com/bramus/status/1493330153681920001?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). It’s like if the browser re-ordered your styles instead of using the order defined in the CSS file. This also [reminds me a bit hooks React](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1056594421079261185?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) 😅.Why does it matter? Because bundlers and frontend tools don’t have any clear rule to emit the bundled CSS in a correct predictible order. For example, with Webpack, CSS loaders, JS/CSS code-splitting, dynamic imports, CJS/ESM, do you really know in which order your CSS rules will be in the final page? Definitively not me! 🤷‍♂️With this new feature, your CSS may become more portable. If you decide to use another bundler/tool someday, you don’t want to have to rewrite everything and fix a ton of little CSS issues related to changes in the CSS insertion order: layers can prevent that.There’s a lot of activity on the CSS side these days. Also take a look at the [Interop 2022](https://www.bram.us/2022/02/13/interop-2022/?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) project: features that browsers plan to focus on this year regarding browser compatibility, including cascade layers!
