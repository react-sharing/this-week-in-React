This Week In React #101: Astro, Redwood, Next.js, Remix, React-Admin, Rust reducers, WebComponents, Gatsby, TypeScript, Rome...
===

Hi everyone!

A nice diversity of React articles this week! I liked those with Rust/WASM and Web-Components.

Last week was Launch Week for Astro and Redwood, there were some exciting announcements.

It's calm on the React-Native side.

TypeScript 4.7 is available in beta, another great release with ESM support in particular!

We have more than **4000 subscribers** here! Thanks for reading me every week ;)

Note: I'm still figuring out how to make this newsletter sustainable. If your company could [sponsor](https://gist.github.com/slorber/cb732fb5d0a002c4d73236a9baeba7bb?utm_campaign=thisweekinreact&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) the newsletter (product, job, conf ad) please let me know or put me in touch. I [build this newsletter transparently in public](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/french-react-newsletter?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), sharing my current income and after 2 years it covers like 50% of my hourly rate. Not too bad, but a little help will be appreciated üòâ I'm still not very good at selling ads on the English newsletter üòÖ it seems to require more cold-outreach.

## React

[**Astro Server-Side Rendering**](https://astro.build/blog/experimental-server-side-rendering/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Astro is a modern meta-framework capable of using any UI lib (including React). It now supports server-side rendering, available experimentally in [v1.0 beta](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1-beta-release/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter). Like Remix, the framework offers a layer of [adapters](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/integrations?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) for deployment to multiple targets.

[**React-admin V4: Build Your Own Framework**](https://marmelab.com/blog/2022/04/11/react-admin-v4-build-your-own-framework.html?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Fran√ßois takes as an example a simple admin interface in React, based on MUI and React-Hook-Form. The code is initially quite verbose, 90 lines. He gradually refactors this code by creating reusable abstractions, to end up with a declarative and expressive code of 20 lines.

He explains that these abstractions are actually the v4 of React-Admin ([v4.0.0-RC.1](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.1?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) available). This new version is based on a more modern stack and is more modular: it exposes high-level components (based on MUI by default, can be swapped) but also low-level primitives to create your own framework. See also the full [series of v4 articles](https://marmelab.com/en/blog/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#react-admin).

[**An Overlooked Factor For Performance Optimization In React**](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/top-level-perf?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Interesting reflection on the need (or not) to memoize the value of a React context according to the position of the provider in the tree. Personally, I still prefer to always memoize for safety, as you never know if the provider will not be moved somewhere else.

[**Writing Redux Reducers in Rust**](https://fiberplane.dev/blog/writing-redux-reducers-in-rust/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Feedback on the integration of existing Rust business code into a React app through WebAssembly and the challenges encountered: non-ideal binding, serialization WASM bridge cost... They need to access the same state on both sides (Rust and TypeScript). Solution: create the reducers in Rust, and return a state diff to TypeScript.

Shows how to use React to create a Web Component. It looks relatively simple, and can be useful in some specific contexts ü§î. Not to be confused with the use of Web Components from React ([will be officially supported later](https://twitter.com/reactjs/status/1508899112074231810?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).

Gives some hints on when/how to split into smaller subcomponents. Also evokes an important Clean Code principle (without naming it): [Single Level of Abstraction](https://medium.com/trabe/coding-react-components-single-level-of-abstraction-e60f25676235?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
