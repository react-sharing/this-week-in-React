This Week In React #97: React vs Solid, Headless Components, FS-structure, Remotion, Gatsby, React-Native, Expo, Skia, Vitest, Socket, Interop 2022...

## React

[**Solid.js feels like what I always wanted React to be**](https://typeofnan.dev/solid-js-feels-like-what-i-always-wanted-react-to-be/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Explains why Solid is simpler than React. Solid is reactive and directly updates the DOM (without virtual DOM). The render function is only called once, even if the state changes, and there are no stale closure issues. A good article to discover the differences between these 2 frameworks and discover Solid.

I find Solid really interesting. In the short term it can be a very good alternative to React for web apps. However, I am waiting to see the practical use of the innovations of React 18 because I think that the virtual DOM is interesting for the highly anticipated concurrent features.

[**Headless components in React and why I stopped using a UI library for our design system**](https://medium.com/@nirbenyair/headless-components-in-react-and-why-i-stopped-using-ui-libraries-a8208197c268?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Nir tells his story: from using React-Bootstrap and MUI to implementing an autocomplete from scratch, to ending up using a headless lib that encapsulates behavior and accessibility. A good intro to understand the interest of headless libs, which also lists the popular libs of the ecosystem.

[**Screaming Architecture: Evolution of a React folder structure and why to group by features right away**](https://profy.dev/article/react-folder-structure?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Johannes shows us how he gradually refactors his file-system structure to keep his app maintainable over time. An interesting line of thought. I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all solution that works for everyone. Personally I like fractal trees, and I would love for [IDEs to offer a way to tag files](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1501204809193566220?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).

[**What's New at GatsbyConf 2022**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/whats-new-at-gatsbyconf-2022/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Gatsby now offers an [Image CDN](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/image-cdn-lightning-fast-image-processing-for-gatsby-cloud/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) that reduces build times and optimizes loading (Note: Netlify offers [an equivalent](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-gatsby/blob/main/docs/image-cdn.md?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)). Other notable improvements announced: incremental deploys, full TypeScript support, GitHub Enterprise, trailing slash...

[**Hooks: React's do-notation**](https://devanshj.me/writings/hooks-reacts-do-notation?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

For FP lovers. Devansh explains that you can convert each hook to a render-prop, but not the other way around. Hooks are just syntactic sugar to avoid the "callback hell". It is related to Haskell monads and the do notation. Show various interesting experiments like implementing conditional rendering, or using generator functions for hooks.

## React-Native


[**Expo: EAS Update Preview Progress**](https://blog.expo.dev/eas-update-preview-progress-f504a30066fc?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Expo shares its progress on EAS Update, the new Over-The-Air update system currently in preview. It is possible to associate a release channel with a Git branch and do continuous delivery. They also improved performance, security, and are working on a web UI to make it easier to use.

[**React Native + Github Action = ‚ù§Ô∏è**](https://www.obytes.com/blog/react-native-github-action?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

Offers a complete workflow to automate the build of React-Native apps. The build is triggered when a new GitHub release is created. There is a bit of work, but it shows that Fastlane may not be so essential anymore.

[**Socket: Secure your JavaScript supply chain**](https://socket.dev/?utm_campaign=This%20Week%20In%20React&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)

New tool to detect supply-chain security vulnerabilities: compromised npm libs you use in your apps.

Offers a different and pro-active approach: rather than looking for known vulnerabilities, assumes that any npm package may be compromised and looks for indicators based on the history of packages that have already been compromised. A tool to adopt quickly, given the number of attacks of this type is increasing sharply. Read also:
